# Retention dataset generator

This is a small Ruby script used to create a simple dataset to showcase retention lifecycle. It allows you to export the dataset to either a CSV or to Mixpanel.

You'll be able to segment and find customers that are:
  - New
  - Current
  - Resurrected
  - Churned

The goal is not to provide a hyper-realistic dataset, but to allow students to get familiar with the concept, and find the segments.
